# Year_2_Project
This project was to analyse data from an X-ray diffraction experiment to determine the lattice parameter of a metal alloy.
This particular project was similar to my year 1 project B whilst also being more challenging. I was required to process a large dataset containing values from an experiment with incrementally varying magnetic field strengths. I was then needing to separate this data into different arrays before arranging it and plotting it on multiple graphs, as can be seen in the final report.
